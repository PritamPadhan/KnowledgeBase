the manufacturer of the device on the drawing, see Annex 3 (see e.g. Parts 1,
and 4).
This shall be declared according to one of the following conditions:
(a) In the case where the outer lens is textured, the declared light emitting
surface shall be all or part of the exterior surface of the outer lens;
(b) In the case where the outer lens is non-textured the outer lens may be

reflector, then the projection of that part only is taken into account.
10
-----


In the case of a dipped-beam headlamp, the illuminating surface is limited by
the apparent trace of the cut-off on to the lens. If the reflector and lens are
adjustable relative to one another, the mean adjustment should be used.
In the case of AFS being installed: where a lighting function is produced by
two or more simultaneously operated lighting units on a given side of the
vehicle, the individual illuminating surfaces, taken together, constitute the
illuminating surface to be considered (for example, in the figure of
paragraph 6.22.4. below, the individual illuminating surfaces of the lighting
units 8, 9 and 11, regarded together and taking into account their respective
location, constitute the illuminating surface to be considered for the right
hand side of the vehicle).
2.9.2. "Illuminating surface of a light-signalling device other than a retro-reflector"
(paragraphs 2.7.11. to 2.7.15., 2.7.18., 2.7.20. and 2.7.22. to 2.7.25) means
the orthogonal projection of the lamp in a plane perpendicular to its axis of
reference and in contact with the exterior light-emitting surface of the lamp,
this projection being bounded by the edges of screens situated in this plane,
each allowing only 98 per cent of the total luminous intensity of the light to
persist in the direction of the axis of reference.
To determine the lower, upper and lateral limits of the illuminating surface
only screens with horizontal or vertical edges shall be used to verify the
distance to the extreme edges of the vehicle and the height above the ground.
For other applications of the illuminating surface, e.g. distance between two
lamps or functions, the shape of the periphery of this illuminating surface
shall be used. The screens shall remain parallel, but other orientations are
allowed to be used.
In the case of a light-signalling device whose illuminating surface encloses
either totally or partially the illuminating surface of another function or
encloses a non-lighted surface, the illuminating surface may be considered to
be the light emitting surface itself (see e.g. Annex 3, Parts 2, 3, 5 and 6).
2.9.3. "Illuminating surface of a retro-reflector" (paragraph 2.7.16.) means, as
declared by the applicant during the component approval procedure for the
retro-reflectors, the orthogonal projection of a retro-reflector in a plane
perpendicular to its axis of reference and delimited by planes contiguous to
the declared outermost parts of the retro-reflectors' optical system and
parallel to that axis. For the purposes of determining the lower, upper and
lateral edges of the device, only horizontal and vertical planes shall be
considered.
2.10. The "apparent surface" for a defined direction of observation means, at the
request of the manufacturer or his duly accredited representative, the
orthogonal projection of:
Either the boundary of the illuminating surface projected on the exterior
surface of the lens;
Or the light-emitting surface;
Only in the case of a light-signalling device producing variable luminous
intensities, its apparent surface that may be variable as specified in
paragraph 2.7.1.3. shall be considered under all conditions permitted by the
variable intensity control, if applicable.
11
-----

most exterior point of the lens. Different examples of the application of
apparent surface can be found in Annex 3 to this Regulation.
2.11. "Axis of reference" (or "reference axis") means the characteristic axis of the
lamp determined by the manufacturer (of the lamp) for use as the direction of
reference (H = 0°, V = 0°) for angles of field for photometric measurements
and for installing the lamp on the vehicle.
2.12. "Centre of reference" means the intersection of the axis of reference with the
exterior light-emitting surface; it is specified by the manufacturer of the
lamp.
2.13. "Angles of geometric visibility" means the angles which determine the field of
the minimum solid angle in which the apparent surface of the lamp is visible.
That field of the solid angle is determined by the segments of the sphere of
which the centre coincides with the centre of reference of the lamp and the
equator is parallel with the ground. These segments are determined in
relation to the axis of reference. The horizontal angles ß correspond to the
longitude and the vertical angles α to the latitude.
2.14. "Extreme outer edge" on either side of the vehicle, means the plane parallel
to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle and touching its lateral outer
edge, disregarding the projection:

specified in paragraph 2.7.
2.15. "Overall dimensions" means the distance between the two vertical planes
defined in paragraph 2.14. above.
2.15.1. "Overall width" means the distance between the two vertical planes defined
in paragraph 2.14. above.

vehicle, and is not less than 0.8 m long; the illumination of such surface shall
be provided by not less than two light sources placed as close as possible to
its ends; the light-emitting surface may be constituted by a number of
juxtaposed elements on condition that the projections of the several
individual light-emitting surfaces on a transverse plane occupy not less than
60 per cent of the area of the smallest rectangle circumscribing the
projections of the said individual light-emitting surfaces.

5.18.2. In the case where the functions referred to in paragraph 5.18. are obtained by
an assembly of two lamps marked "D" (see paragraph 2.16.1.), only one of
the lamps needs to meet the position, geometric visibility and photometric
requirements for those lamps at all fixed positions of the movable
components.
or
5.18.3. Where additional lamps for the above functions are fitted and are activated,
when the movable component is in any fixed open position, provided that
these additional lamps satisfy all the position, geometric visibility and
photometric requirements applicable to the lamps installed on the movable
component.
5.18.4. In the case where the functions referred to in paragraph 5.18. are obtained by
an interdependent lamp system either of the following conditions shall apply:
(a) Should the complete interdependent lamp system be mounted on the
moving component(s), the requirements of paragraph 5.18.1. shall be
satisfied. However, additional lamps for the above functions may be
activated, when the movable component is in any fixed open position,
provided that these additional lamps satisfy all the position, geometric
visibility, colorimetric and photometric requirements applicable to the
lamps installed on the movable component.
or
(b) Should the interdependent lamp system be partly mounted on the fixed
component and partly mounted on a movable component, with the
exception of direction indicator lamps, the interdependent lamp(s)
specified by the Applicant during the device approval procedure shall
meet all the position, outwards geometric visibility, colorimetric and
photometric requirements for those lamps, at all fixed positions of the
movable component(s).
The inwards geometric visibility requirement(s) is(are) deemed to be
satisfied if this(these) interdependent lamp(s) still conform(s) to the
photometric values prescribed in the field of light distribution for the
approval of the device, at all fixed positions of the movable
component(s).
For direction indicator lamps, the interdependent lamp(s) specified by

angular inclination of these lamps, relative to its support, measured after each
operation of the movable component, differs by more than 0.15 per cent from
the average of the 10 measured values. If this value is exceeded each limit
specified in paragraph 6.2.6.1.1. shall then be modified by this excess to
decrease the allowed range of inclinations when checking the vehicle
according to Annex 6.
5.21. The apparent surface in the direction of the reference axis of front and rear
position lamps, front and rear direction-indicator lamps and retro-reflectors
shall not be hidden more than 50 per cent by any movable component, with
or without a light-signalling device installed on it, in any fixed position
different from the "normal position of use".
Fixed position of a movable component means the stable or natural rest
position(s) of the movable component specified by the vehicle manufacturer,
whether locked or not.
If the above requirement is not practicable:
5.21.1. Additional lamps satisfying all the position, geometric visibility, colorimetric
and photometric requirements for the above indicated lamps shall be
activated when the apparent surface in the direction of the reference axis of
these lamps is more than 50 per cent hidden by the movable component; or
5.21.2. A remark in the communication form (item 10.1. of Annex 1) shall inform
other Administrations that more than 50 per cent of the apparent surface in
the direction of the reference axis can be hidden by the movable components;
and
A notice in the vehicle shall inform the user that in certain position(s) of the
movable components other road users shall be warned of the presence of the
vehicle on the road; for example by means of a warning triangle or other
devices according to national requirements for use on the road.
5.21.3. Paragraph 5.21.2. does not apply to retro-reflectors.

Annex 6
Annex 6
 Measurement of the variation of dipped-beam inclination as
 a function of load
1. Scope
This annex specifies a method for measuring variations in motor vehicle
dipped-beam inclination, in relation to its initial inclination, caused by
changes in vehicle attitude due to loading.
2. Definitions
2.1. Initial inclination
2.1.1. Stated initial inclination
The value of the dipped-beam initial inclination specified by the motor
vehicle manufacturer serving as a reference value for the calculation of
permissible variations.
2.1.2. Measured initial inclination
The mean value of dipped-beam inclination or vehicle inclination measured
with the vehicle in condition No. 1, as defined in Annex 5, for the category of
vehicle under test. It serves as a reference value for the assessment of
variations in beam inclination as the load varies.
2.2. Dipped-beam inclination
It may be defined as follows:
Either as the angle, expressed in milliradians, between the direction of the
beam towards a characteristic point on the horizontal part of the cut-off in the
luminous distribution of the headlamp and the horizontal plane,
Or by the tangent of that angle, expressed in percentage inclination, since the
angles are small (for these small angles, 1 per cent is equal to 10 mrad).
If the inclination is expressed in percentage inclination, it can be calculated
by means of the following formula:
(h1  h2 )
x 100
L
where:
h1 is the height above the ground, in millimetres, of the abovementioned characteristic point, measured on a vertical screen
perpendicular to the vehicle longitudinal median plane, placed at a
horizontal distance L.
h2 is the height above the ground, in millimetres, of the centre of
reference (which is taken to be the nominal origin of the characteristic
point chosen in h1):
L is the distance, in millimetres, from the screen to the centre of
reference.
112
-----


Annex 6
Negative values denote downward inclination (see Figure 1).
Positive values denote upward inclination.
Figure 1
Dipped-beam downward inclination of a category M1 vehicle
_Notes:_
1. This drawing represents a category M1 vehicle, but the principle
shown applies equally to vehicles of other categories.
2. Where the vehicle does not incorporate a headlamp levelling system,
the variation in dipped-beam inclination is identical with the variation in the
inclination of the vehicle itself.
3. Measurement conditions
3.1. If a visual inspection of the dipped-beam pattern on the screen or a
photometric method is used, measurement shall be carried out in a dark
environment (for example, a dark room) of sufficient area to allow the
vehicle and the screen to be placed as shown in Figure 1. Headlamp centres
of reference shall be at a distance from the screen of at least 10 m.
3.2. The ground on which measurements are made shall be as flat and horizontal
as possible, so that the reproducibility of measurements of dipped-beam
inclination can be assured with an accuracy of  0.5 mrad (±0.05 per cent
inclination).
3.3. If a screen is used, its marking, position and orientation in relation to the
ground and to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle, shall be such that
the reproducibility of the measurement of the dipped-beam inclination can be
assured with an accuracy of 0.5 mrad (0.05 per cent inclination).
3.4. During measurements, the ambient temperature shall be between 10 and 30 °C.
4. Vehicle preparation
4.1. Measurements shall be carried out on a vehicle which has travelled a distance
of between 1,000 km and 10,000 km, preferably 5,000 km.
4.2. Tyres shall be inflated to the full-load pressure specified by the vehicle
manufacturer. The vehicle shall be fully replenished (fuel, water, oil) and
equipped with all the accessories and tools specified by the manufacturer.
Full fuel replenishment means that the fuel tank shall be filled to not less than
90 per cent of its capacity.
4.3. The vehicle shall have the parking brake released and the gearbox in neutral.
113
-----


Annex 6
4.4. The vehicle shall be conditioned for at least 8 h at the temperature specified
in paragraph 3.4. above.
4.5. If a photometric or visual method is used, headlamps with a well- defined
dipped-beam cut-off should preferably be installed on the vehicle under test
in order to facilitate the measurements. Other means are allowed to obtain a
more precise reading (for example, removal of the headlamp lens).
5. Test procedure
5.1. General
The variations in either dipped-beam or vehicle inclination, depending on the
method chosen, shall be measured separately for each side of the vehicle.
The results obtained from both left and right headlamps under all the load
conditions specified in Annex 5, shall be within the limits set out in
paragraph 5.5. below. The load shall be applied gradually without subjecting
the vehicle to excessive shocks.
5.1.1. Where an AFS is fitted, the measurements shall be carried out with the AFS
in its neutral state.
5.2. Determination of the measured initial inclination
The vehicle shall be prepared as specified in paragraph 4. above and laden as
specified in Annex 5 (first loading condition of the respective vehicle
category). Before each measurement, the vehicle shall be rocked as specified
in paragraph 5.4. below. Measurements shall be made three times.
5.2.1. If none of the three measured results differ by more than 2 mrad (0.2 per cent
inclination) from the arithmetic mean of the results, that mean shall constitute
the final result.
5.2.2. If any measurement differs from the arithmetic mean of the results by more
than 2 mrad (0.2 per cent inclination), a further series of 10 measurements
shall be made, the arithmetic mean of which shall constitute the final result.
5.3. Measurement methods
Any method may be used to measure variations of inclination provided that
the readings are accurate to within ±0.2 mrad (±0.02 per cent inclination).
5.4. Treatment of vehicle in each loading condition
The vehicle suspension and any other part likely to affect dipped-beam
inclination shall be activated according to the methods described below.
However, the technical authorities and manufacturers may jointly propose
other methods (either experimental or based upon calculations), especially
when the test poses particular problems, provided such calculations are
clearly valid.
5.4.1. M1 category vehicles with conventional suspension
With the vehicle standing on the measuring site and, if necessary, with the
wheels resting on floating platforms (which shall be used if their absence
would lead to restriction of the suspension movement likely to affect the
results of measurements), rock the vehicle continuously for at least three
complete cycles, for each cycle, first the rear and then the front end of the
vehicle is pushed down.
114
-----


Annex 6
The rocking sequence shall end with the completion of a cycle. Before
making the measurements, the vehicle shall be allowed to come to rest
spontaneously. Instead of using floating platforms, the same effect can be
achieved by moving the vehicle backwards and forwards for at least a
complete wheel revolution.
5.4.2. M2, M3 and N category vehicles with conventional suspension
5.4.2.1. If the treatment method for category M1 vehicles described in
paragraph 5.4.1. is not possible, the method described in paragraphs 5.4.2.2.
or 5.4.2.3. may be used.
5.4.2.2. With the vehicle standing on the measuring site and the wheels on the
ground, rock the vehicle by temporarily varying the load.
5.4.2.3. With the vehicle standing on the measuring site and the wheels on the
ground, activate the vehicle suspension and all other parts which may affect
the dipped-beam inclination by using a vibration rig. This can be a vibrating
platform on which the wheels rest.
5.4.3. Vehicles with non-conventional suspension, where the engine has to be
running.
Before making any measurement wait until the vehicle has assumed its final
attitude with the engine running.
5.5. Measurements
The variation of the inclination of the dipped-beam shall be assessed for each
of the different loading conditions in relation to the measured initial
inclination determined in accordance with paragraph 5.2. above.
If the vehicle is fitted with a manual headlamp-levelling system, the latter
shall be adjusted to the positions specified by the manufacturer for given
loading conditions (according to Annex 5).
5.5.1. To begin with, a single measurement shall be made in each loading condition.
Requirements have been met if, for all the loading conditions, the variation in
inclination is within the calculated limits (for example, within the difference
between the stated initial inclination and the lower and upper limits specified
for approval) with a safety margin of 4 mrad (0.4 per cent inclination).
5.5.2. If the result(s) of any measurement(s) does (do) not lie within the safety
margin indicated in paragraph 5.5.1. or exceed(s) the limit values, a further
three measurements shall be made in the loading conditions corresponding to
this (these) result(s) as specified in paragraph 5.5.3.
5.5.3. For each of the above loading conditions:
5.5.3.1. If none of the three measured results differs by more than 2 mrad (0.2 per
cent inclination) from the arithmetic mean of the results, that mean shall
constitute the final result.
5.5.3.2. If any measurement differs from the arithmetic mean of the results by more
than 2 mrad (0.2 per cent inclination), a further series of 10 measurements
shall be made, the arithmetic mean of which shall constitute the final result.
115
-----


Annex 6
5.5.3.3. If a vehicle is fitted with an automatic headlamp-levelling system which has
an inherent hysteresis loop, average results at the top and bottom of the
hysteresis loop shall be taken as significant values.
All these measurements shall be made in accordance with paragraphs 5.5.3.1.
and 5.5.3.2.
5.5.4. Requirements have been met, if, under all loading conditions, the variation
between the measured initial inclination determined in accordance with
paragraph 5.2. and the inclination measured under each loading condition is
less than the values calculated in paragraph 5.5.1. (without safety margin).
5.5.5. If only one of the calculated upper or lower limits of variation is exceeded,
the manufacturer shall be permitted to choose a different value for the stated
initial inclination, within the limits specified for approval.
